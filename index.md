# Lab 3
In this lab, I explored different options that can be used with `grep` that I think could be very useful in the future. Grep is a very useful tool that scans files in a given directory. It matches the contents of the file to a given string and returns the file names as well as the lines in which the matching string appears. 
For reference, the working directory that was used during these examples was `Users/Paola/Documents/Github/docsearch/`, here is what it looks like:


üìÇ`docsearch`

   üìÇ`technical`
   
      üìÅ `biomed`
      
       üìÅ`plos`



## Examples of `grep -r`

Input 1:
```
$ grep -r "four monkeys" ./technical/plos/*

```

Output 1:
```
./technical/plos/pmed.0020278.txt:        vaccine was successful in four monkeys, and, thus, is a suitable agent for human study [2].
```
In this example, we use command `grep -r` to search through all the files inside the _plos_ folder and returned the name and line where the `string` "four monkeys" appeared. 


Input 2:
```
$ grep -r "four monkeys" ./technical/biomed/*
```

Output 2:
```

```


In this example, the command `grep -r` searched through the files inside the _biomed_ folder looking for the same string from the previous example but it returned nothing as no files matched the string.


## Examples of `grep -i`

Input 1:
```
$ grep -i "FouR monKeys" ./technical/plos/*

```

Output 1:
```
./technical/plos/pmed.0020278.txt:        vaccine was successful in four monkeys, and, thus, is a suitable agent for human study [2].
```

Normally, the command `grep` performs a case-sensitive search for the given `string`. By using `grep -i`, I can type "FouR monKeys" and the text will still match. We can see that it returned the relative path and line number that matched the `string`.

Input 2:
```
$ grep -i "caesar" ./technical/biomed/*
```

Output 2:

```
./technical/biomed/1471-2288-1-9.txt:          probability of Caesarian section, other forms of
```
Here, we can observe that even though the `string` "caesar" was written in lower-case, there was still a match with the text file's `string` containing the word "Ceasarian".


## Examples of `grep -w`

Input 1:
```
$ grep -w "caesar" ./technical/biomed/*
```

Output 1:
```

```

When we use `grep -w`, the command looks for the given string as is, without letters prior to it or after it. We know that there is a file that contains the word "Caesarian" in this folder, but `grep -w` does not let this match, returning nothing.



Input 2:
```
$ grep -w "Caesarian section" ./technical/biomed/*
```

Output 2:
```
./technical/biomed/1471-2288-1-9.txt:          probability of Caesarian section, other forms of
```

Here, we can note that I wrote a `string` composed of two words, and the output was the relative path of a file containing those words exactly, along the lines the exact `string` appears on.


## Examples of `grep -l`

Input 1:
```
$ grep -l "Caesar" ./technical/biomed/*
```


```
./technical/biomed/1471-2288-1-9.txt
```

Using `grep -l` yields the same result as `grep` but it excludes the lines and line numbers where the given `string` appears.

Input 2:
```
$ grep -l "hypoxia" ./technical/biomed/*
```

Output 2:
```
./technical/biomed/1471-2199-3-10.txt
./technical/biomed/1471-2210-1-8.txt
./technical/biomed/1471-2369-3-1.txt
./technical/biomed/1471-2407-2-8.txt
./technical/biomed/1472-6750-1-11.txt
./technical/biomed/1472-6793-2-8.txt
./technical/biomed/1476-4598-2-25.txt
./technical/biomed/cc1538.txt
./technical/biomed/cc1547.txt
./technical/biomed/cc3.txt
./technical/biomed/cvm-2-6-278.txt
./technical/biomed/rr74.txt
```

The command `grep -l` is most useful when the search will yield many results in order to make the information returned much easier to read. 
Here is what ``` $ grep "hypoxia" ./technical/biomed/* ``` returned, for comparison:
