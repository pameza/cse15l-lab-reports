# Week 1 lab blog :)
During the first week's lab we were introduced to remote access through VS Code. Initially, we were taught to download VS Code and then gather our log-in information. To download VS Code, we accessed the [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) to download the installer that was appropriate for our operating system and followed the instructions to download the program.

Now that VS Code is running, we are able to run some commands such as the following:
- cd ~
- cd
- ls -lat
- ls -a

this commands ran on my computer and generated some lines that referred to my current directory and the folders containing it. In order to run these commands on the server, I had to follow several steps to find my log in information. First, I found my username by follwoing the instructions in this [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and plugging in said username in the blanks of this `ssh _____@ieng6.ucsd.edu` inside of the terminal. To access the terminal, click Terminal - New Terminal in the top bar. I used the password reset tool to get a new password for this assignment and waited a little over 30 minutes to continue. After this, I was asked if I wanted to continue and I typed "yes". Then, I was asked for my password and upon writing my password, I was able to access the remote server where I could once again type the commands mentioned above, yielding a different result this time.
